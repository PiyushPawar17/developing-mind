As a beginner, when you learn to write Node.js code, you end up writing all the code in a single file. The code contains mostly the basic stuff like declaring and using variables, conditionals, loops and functions just to understand the language. Later you learn how to build a server in Node.js, handle routes, write logic for specific routes and send responses. You realise that the only file you've been working on is getting bigger and bigger and its hard to keep track of things.

Thats where the modules come to rescue. The code now can be written in separate files and then later can be imported in the required files. This helps to structure our code and also reuse it. For this, we've been using the `require()` function in Node. If we want to use code from some file we just use the `require()` function to import the contents from it, assign it to a variable and use it.

## What most people think about `require()`

To learn the module system, some may have watched tutorials online or read blogs about it. So, a `require()` statement takes the content of the given file and stores it in a variable (if assigned). But, the one thing that we're also been told is that the `require()` statement also runs the file. Meaning, if the file executes some function in it will be executed when the file is required.

This is where people develop a thought about how `require()` statement works. People think that the file is executed every time we require it. This is what they learnt, right? The `require()` statement executes the file when required. And its true, but not entirely. Let's see how.

## The reality

Let's say we have two files - `index.js` and `counter.js`. The `counter.js` file contains a variable initialized to 0 and it exports two functions - `getCounter` and `incrementCounter`.

```js:counter.js
let counter = 0;

module.exports = {
	getCounter() {
		return counter;
	},
	incrementCounter() {
		++counter;
	}
};
```

Now, let's require this file in our `index.js`.

```js:index.js
const counter = require('./counter');

console.log(counter.getCounter()); // 0

counter.incrementCounter(); // Increments to 1
counter.incrementCounter(); // Increments to 2
counter.incrementCounter(); // Increments to 3

console.log(counter.getCounter()); // 3
```

Initially, the counter will be 0. Then we increment it 3 times and the value of counter becomes 3. This is all expected. But, let's require the file one more time and store it in separate variable and try to log the counter variable again.

```js{11,13}:index.js
const counter = require('./counter');

console.log(counter.getCounter()); // 0

counter.incrementCounter(); // Increments to 1
counter.incrementCounter(); // Increments to 2
counter.incrementCounter(); // Increments to 3

console.log(counter.getCounter()); // 3

const counter2 = require('./counter');

console.log(counter2.getCounter()); // 3
```

Now, we require the `counter.js` file second time. So, it will run the file again. In that case, the `counter` variable will again be set to 0. The `counter2.getCounter()` must return 0. Surprisingly, it returns 3. How? We just required the file again so it must reset the variable to 0 for `counter2`. Thats where Node's require cache comes into play.

The `require()` function caches the required file and when it sees another require statement for the same file, rather than requiring the file and executing it again, it just returns the cached version. Because of this, the file is never executed second time in our example and the value of `counter` remains 3.

> Although it's true that files are executed whenever they are required, but the reality is that they are only executed once even if you require them multiple times in multiple files.

### A complex example (optional)

Let's see a more complex example. This is just for demo, its fine if you don't understand this as there is very rare chance that you will face this issue. Now, lets get started.

We'll create 4 files - `index.js`, `counter.js`, `testFile1.js` and `testFile2.js` which will have the following contents.

```js:counter.js
let counter = 0;

module.exports = {
	getCounter() {
		return counter;
	},
	incrementCounter() {
		++counter;
	}
};
```

```js:testFile1.js
const counter = require('./counter');
require('./testFile2');

console.log('----- Test File 1 Start -----');
console.log(counter.getCounter());

counter.incrementCounter();
counter.incrementCounter();
counter.incrementCounter();

console.log(counter.getCounter());

console.log('----- Test File 1 End -----');
```

```js:testFile2.js
const counter = require('./counter');

console.log('----- Test File 2 Start -----');
console.log(counter.getCounter());

counter.incrementCounter();
counter.incrementCounter();
counter.incrementCounter();

console.log(counter.getCounter());

console.log('----- Test File 2 End -----');
```

```js{1,2}:index.js
const counter = require('./counter');

console.log('----- Index File Start -----');
console.log(counter.getCounter());

counter.incrementCounter();
counter.incrementCounter();
counter.incrementCounter();

console.log(counter.getCounter());

const counter2 = require('./counter');

console.log(counter2.getCounter());

require('./testFile1');
require('./testFile2');

console.log(counter2.getCounter());
console.log('----- Index File End -----');
```

When you run `index.js` this is the following output you get. Let's see what it really means. The index file requires the `counter.js` file. Later, it console logs `----- Index File Start -----`. Initially, the counter is 0, so the first `getCounter()` statement returns 0. We then increment the counter 3 times and we get the value 3. This is what everyone expects till now.

Now, we again require the counter file. As we now know that files are cached, we expect to see the returned value to be 3 and thats what we get.

Let's require another file, that is `testFile1.js`. As we can see it also requires the `counter.js` file. Below that, it requires the `testFile2.js`. Now `testFile2.js` was never required till now so node will execute this file. There we can see `counter.js` was required again. As `counter.js` is cached, `testFile2.js` will have the value of `counter` variable as 3 (as it was incremented 3 times already in `index.js`). So it will again increment the value of the `counter` variable 3 times and now we have `counter` equal to 6.

Requiring `testFile2.js` was at very top of the `testFile1.js`. That means we still need to run `testFile1.js`. We do the same thing that we did in `testFile2.js`. But, the value of `counter` has been changed to 6 by `testFile2.js`. So even if we've required `counter.js` above the `testFile2.js`, the value of `counter` variable still changed. Now, `testFile1.js` also increments `counter` by 3 which means the value of it is now 9.

Its not over yet. This was only the `require('./testFile1')` statement we addressed in `index.js` till now. That means the next statement to be executed will be `require('./testFile2')`, that is to require `testFile2.js`. But the file was already been required in `testFile1.js`, so node will return the cached version of `testFile2.js`. That means it won't run again. Which in turn means it won't call the `incrementCounter()` function 3 times and the value of `counter` remains 9. We can see that in the last log of `index.js` file.

```:index.js
Output of index.js

----- Index File Start -----
0
3
3
----- Test File 2 Start -----
3
6
----- Test File 2 End -----
----- Test File 1 Start -----
6
9
----- Test File 1 End -----
9
----- Index File End -----
```

This example might have given you even better idea of how `require()` works. You can even check the cache by console logging `require.cache`. It will log the cached files with some more data.

## Even works with `import` statements

This also works with the `import` statements. You can even try by changing the `require()` statements to `import`. You'll have to setup babel so that you can use the `import` statements. Also, `import` statements needs to be declared at the top of the file. Which means the following code is not valid.

```ts{12}:index.ts
import counter from './counter';

console.log('----- Index File Start -----');
console.log(counter.getCounter());

counter.incrementCounter();
counter.incrementCounter();
counter.incrementCounter();

console.log(counter.getCounter());

import counter2 from './counter';

console.log(counter2.getCounter());
```

Node will complain about the given line. Just move the import statements at the top and the results will be same as we saw.

## Final thoughts

This is something that you won't run into everyday. You might not even have any issue because of this in your whole career. It is still good to know the internal workings of anything to be a better developer.
