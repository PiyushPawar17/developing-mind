Till now we learned various things about objects, how they're created and how tey behave. In this post, we'll see the `Object.create()` function which is a new way to create objects.

## Exploring `Object.create()`

The `Object.create()` function creates a new object with the prototype set to certain object. This might not be easiest thing to understand if you haven't read the previous posts. Let's see an example to get a better overview.

```js
const weapon = {
	hit: function () {
		console.log(this.damage);
	}
};

const sword = Object.create(weapon);
sword.damage = 24;
sword.hit(); // 24
```

Here, we create an object with a `hit` method in it. The `hit` method just prints out the damage property. The `Object.create()` will create a new object and set the prototype of that object to be weapon. Then, we add the damage property to the `sword` object which is later printed by calling the `hit` method. We can verify that the `weapon` object is prototype of `sword`.

```js{11}
const weapon = {
	hit: function() {
		console.log(this.damage);
	}
};

const sword = Object.create(weapon);
sword.damage = 24;
sword.hit(); // 24

console.log(weapon.isPrototypeOf(sword)); // true
```

The `isPrototypeOf` function returns `true` for the above condition. Meaning that `sword` inherits some properties from `weapon`.

## Implementing `Object.create()`

From the sort of definition given earlier, `Object.create()` is fairly easy to implement.

```js{7-12}
const weapon = {
	hit: function() {
		console.log(this.damage);
	}
};

function objectCreate(proto) {
	const obj = {};
	// Bad performance
	Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto);
	return obj;
}

const sword = Object.create(weapon);
sword.damage = 24;
sword.hit(); // 24

console.log(weapon.isPrototypeOf(sword)); // true
```

The `Object.create()` function creates a new object, same as the `new` keyword does, and sets the prototype of that new object to given object and returns it. This is not the best implementation of `Object.create()` as the `setPrototypeOf()` function has performance issues. Better use `Object.create()` to create one.

The problem with `Object.create()` is it does not have a constructor function that would run as soon as the object is created. People usually add a method in the object and use it as a constructor.

```js{2-4}
const weapon = {
	init: function(damage) {
		this.damage = damage;
	},
	hit: function() {
		console.log(this.damage);
	}
};

const sword = Object.create(weapon);
sword.init(24);
sword.hit(); // 24

console.log(weapon.isPrototypeOf(sword)); // true
```

For example, `init()` method is used as a constructor and is called immediately after using `Object.create()`. One handy thing to do is return `this` from the function used as constructor to chain another method.

```js{4,11}
const weapon = {
	init: function(damage) {
		this.damage = damage;
		return this;
	},
	hit: function() {
		console.log(this.damage);
	}
};

const sword = Object.create(weapon).init(24);
sword.hit(); // 24

console.log(weapon.isPrototypeOf(sword));
```

Returning `this` will return the current object after which the `init` method can be chained to initialize the values.

## Summary

-   The `Object.create()` function creates a new object with the prototype set to certain object.
-   The `Object.create()` does not have constructor that can be used to run some code just as the object is created.
