spoiler: 'Overcoming the problem with "this"'
---

JavaScript has grown a lot in past few years. It has found its applications in almost every field. Because of this many developers try to learn JavaScript. Some of them are beginners while some of them have already been working on other languages like Python, C#, Java, C++. These are all Object Oriented Languages. The concept of objects in these languages are pretty similar. But, in JavaScript, objects behave very differently. This is the reason developers from another language face a lot of issues while dealing with objects in JavaScript. Also, `this` is one of the main reasons developers face issues.

Objects are key part of JavaScript and they work in a weird way. In this series, I'll try to explain how and why the objects behave the way they behave, how objects are actually created in different ways, prototypes and some more things. This was supposed to be a one huge post, but the topics that are covered will make it more confusing to read in one sitting.

In this post, we'll see why `this` has caused a lot of issues and how we can handle it using `.bind()` function.

## Basics

Let's create a basic JavaScript object.

```js
const sword = {
	damage: 33,
	hit: function() {
		console.log(`You did ${this.damage} damage to the enemy`);
	}
};

sword.hit(); // You did 33 damage to the enemy
```

When you call the `.hit()` function, on `sword` object, it will `console.log()` the string. In the string, it will see a variable `this.damage`. It will search for the variable in the object and it will find one with the value of `33` and will log the result as `You did 33 damage to the enemy`. This is an expected result. A basic object is declared in which a function references a variable of the object using `this` keyword and you get the value of that variable correctly.

Now let's try something different. Let's assign that function to a variable üßê.

```js{10}
const sword = {
	damage: 33,
	hit: function() {
		console.log(`You did ${this.damage} damage to the enemy`);
	}
};

sword.hit(); // You did 33 damage to the enemy

const stolenSword = sword.hit;
stolenSword(); // You did undefined damage to the enemy
```

`You did undefined damage to the enemy`!? May be stealing a sword wasn't a great idea. But why is `damage` variable `undefined` here? We assigned the function to a variable and then called that variable. Yes, you can assign a function to a variable in JavaScript. This is because JavaScript is not only object oriented but also a functional language ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. And in functional programming, there is not concept of `this`. That's a whole another topic of discussion.

When we call `stolenSword()`, this is where the object oriented and functional nature of JavaScript clashes. When we re-assign a method connected to a object to a variable, it disconnects from the object. It is just a normal function now. The `stolenSword` function gets disconnected from the `sword` object (and functional nature of JavaScript comes into play) and this is the reason we get `undefined` for the variable `damage`.

An other way to explain it is look at the calling context. In the first example, the `.hit()` is called on `sword` object which has the `damage` property associated with it. In the second example, the `.hit()` method is assigned to `stolenSword` which doesn't have a `damage` property associated with it. The following code might help you understand better.

```js{1-3}
const stolenSword = function() {
	console.log(`You did ${this.damage} damage to the enemy`);
};

stolenSword(); // You did undefined damage to the enemy
```

Here you can clearly see that `stolenSword` does not have any `damage` property and hence we get `undefined`. The `this` keyword does not refer to the context where it was defined, rather it refer to the context where it is called from.

## Binding the Objects

We can achieve the initial behavior with the help of `.bind()` function. The `.bind()` function takes an argument of an object to which you want to the `this` keyword refer to. The `.bind()` function does not modify the original function, instead returns a new function. Let's see this in action.

```js{11,14}
const sword = {
	damage: 33,
	hit: function() {
		console.log(`You did ${this.damage} damage to the enemy`);
	}
};

sword.hit(); // You did 33 damage to the enemy

const stolenSword = sword.hit;
const boundStolenSword = stolenSword.bind(sword);

stolenSword(); // You did undefined damage to the enemy
boundStolenSword(); // You did 33 damage to the enemy
```

The `.bind()` function is called upon `stolenSword` and takes an argument of `sword` object. As you can see rather than modifying the same function it returns a new function that is stored in `boundStolenSword` variable. You can verify that by calling both of them, the `stolenSword` function will still return `undefined` but the `boundStolenSword` returns `33`. The `.bind()` function forces to use `sword` object anytime `this` is referred by `boundStolenSword` function. Hence, we get the value of `damage` as intended.

A real world example of this could be as follows:

```js{10,12}
const sword = {
	damage: 33,
	hit: function() {
		console.log(`You did ${this.damage} damage to the enemy`);
	}
};

const button = document.getElementById('button');

button.addEventListener('click', sword.hit); // You did undefined damage to the enemy

button.addEventListener('click', sword.hit.bind(sword)); // You did 33 damage to the enemy
```

Using vanilla JavaScript we add an event listner to a button. Initially, as a callback function we've just passed the `sword.hit`. When the button will be clicked, the `sword.hit` function will be called but it will have the same issue we saw. `sword.hit` will be called by the global `window` object where all the event listeners are triggred. The `window` object does not have any reference to the `damage` property and we see `undefined` for it.

While in the second callback, we've explictly bound the `this` keyword to the `sword` object. Which means no matter where you call the `sword.hit` function from, the value of `this` will always be `sword` object.

### More examples

We can not only bind the methods of an object but also normal function. We can use `this` inside a normal function and bind it to an object and it will refer `this` to that object.

```js
function run() {
	console.log(`Speed: ${this.speed}`);
}

run(); // Speed: undefined
```

As you can guess, `speed` will return `undefined` and you know the reasons. So what we do? We bind that function to an object that has a speed property.

```js{9,12}
function run() {
	console.log(`Speed: ${this.speed}`);
}

const cheetah = {
	speed: 120
};

const boundRun = run.bind(cheetah);

run(); // Speed: undefined
boundRun(); // Speed: 120
```

If this is what you expected, then you have got a good grasp of `this` and `.bind()`. Another way you can achieve this is placing the function right inside the object, because functions are values you can pass around, like strings, numbers, booleans.

```js
function run() {
	console.log(`Speed: ${this.speed}`);
}

const cheetah = {
	dash: run,
	speed: 120
};

cheetah.dash(); // Speed: 120
```

Nothing special happens to the `run` function. It is just passed to an object where when we call it, it has a reference to `speed` in the object because `this` is now the `cheetah` object. If we call the `run` function normally, it would still return `undefined` for `speed`. This proves that functions are not changed, they are just passed into objects and then refer to those objects. The `dash` and `run` functions are referring to the same function, not even a copy is made.

### ‚ö† Warning! Confusing code ahead

This part will probably make you think for a while, but if you anticipate the output correctly, then you've understood the above things pretty perfectly. Also, never write this kind of code in real applications unless its absolutely necessary.

```js
function run() {
	console.log(`Speed: ${this.speed}`);
}

const animal = {
	sprint: run,
	speed: 50
};

const cheetah = {
	dash: animal.sprint,
	speed: 120
};

cheetah.dash(); // Speed: 120
```

After seeing this code, some people may say that `cheetah.dash` would result in `Speed: 50`. But remember, the `animal.sprint` is a reference to the `run` function. Although, calling `animal.sprint` will give `Speed: 50` as the output, but calling `cheetah.dash` will still give `Speed: 120` as output. Remember, there is just one function, `run`, that is been passed down as a reference and it will output the result as if it was passed normally into the object.

## Summary

-   `this` does not refer to the object where it is defined, but refers to the object from where it is called.
-   `.bind()` does not modify the original function, instead returns a new function with `this` bound to the given object as the argument.
